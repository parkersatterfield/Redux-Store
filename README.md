# **Redux Store**

### *Given a functioning e-commerce platform, students were asked to refactor the existing code to use Redux. This was accomplished by removing global state into a store. This involved deleting the client-side global state util script and adding a store.js file in it's place. Everywhere a global state was called, the code was refactored to fetch data from the store instead.*
